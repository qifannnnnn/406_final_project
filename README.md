# 406_final_project

### Data pre-processing: 

Run covid_data.ipynb + election_data.ipynb + other_data.ipynb

All the cleaned data are in the data file --- presidential_data.csv, covid_data.csv, other_data.csv, additional_data.csv, race_clean.csv, merged.csv

To download data:

a. covid: https://usafacts.org/visualizations/coronavirus-covid-19-spread-map/

b. election:  https://www.kaggle.com/unanimad/us-election-2020?select=president_county_candidate.csv

c. others:  https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/county-level-data-sets/download-data/

https://library.duke.edu/data/sources/popest (race)

For some reasons, the dataset on Kaggle didn't provide the county-level vote data for the six states of new England :( So I manually input the data in the data/additional_data.csv from the election map of NYT (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/results-president.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-elections-2020&region=TOP_BANNER&context=election_recirc).


### Data merging and models

Run merge_data.ipynb (very messy now)

### Paper

project.tex and project.pdf
